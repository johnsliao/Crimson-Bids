        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2><br>
        <p><h4><b>What is Crimson Bids?</b></h4></p>
        <p>Crimson Bids is an online platform aimed to simplify your process to acquire inventory for your eBay business. This tool helps you find high quality auction/inventory products using language processing and by screening out illegitimate listings.</p>
        
        <p>You can read more on the <a href="./about.html">about</a> page.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p><h4><b>How does Crimson Bids work?</b></h4></p>
        <p>Crimson Bids takes many many eBay listings and pushes it through a set of requirements (e.g. seller must have a feedback rating greater than 95%). Then Crimson Bids uses language processing to analyze the seller description and seller notes to categorize specifics about each listing (e.g. if a phone has a cracked screen or if it comes with its original box). </p>
        <p> Listings are then organized for your convenience as a individual buyer or eBay business.</p>
        
        <br>

        
        <p><h4><b>Are these eBay listings up live?</b></h4></p>
        <p>Yes. All listings are updated every 10 minutes, so you can get the latest auction/inventory information. </p><br>
    
    
        <p><h4><b>What is the difference between "like-new" and "for-parts"?</b></h4></p>
        <p><b>Like-new</b>: Products that have been lightly used but are in pristine or mint condition. Products that fall under this category fulfill a stringent set of requirements. For example, for an iPhone product, the physical condition of the phone will have no damage, all functions will be working, and the ESN/IMEID/ICLOUD will be unlocked.</p>
            
        <p><b>For-parts</b>: Products that can be refurbished or disassembled for individual sale/replacement parts. These products have damaged or cracked screens, the ESN/IMEID/ICLOUD may be locked, or some physical functions may not be working (e.g. camera broken).</p><br>

        
    
        <p><h4><b>I clicked on the listing but it says the listing has ended! I thought these were up to date.</b></h4></p>
        <p>Oops! This means another buyer has already paid full asking price for the item. </p><br>
        
        <p><h4><b>I have suggestions for improvements to your service. How can I contact you?</b></h4></p>
        <p>We are always under development to make your experience here better. </p>
