# TechGrab

README

Offers a service-based online platform that simplifies eBay's auctioning process for high-end technology products such as flagship: smart phones, tablets, and laptops.

This service utilizes language processing to find high quality, legitimate auction products via eBay's API and seller's item description. This algorithm ranks and sorts items based on their item descriptions and seller notes.

Users are able to place orders (soon!), identify how much they would be willing to pay, and select quality listings provided by the platform.

This service adds value by providing customers the hassle of searching for a high-quality second hand product and the auction process.
